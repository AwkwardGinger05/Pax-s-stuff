# Pax's stuff
A collection of all my work over the years

Hi! I'm Pax! I'm an aspiring artist with a passion for computers! My dream is to one day work on large scale games and movies after I graduate from college as a 3D Graphics designer! I'm still learning but below you'll be able to find a collection on all the stuff I've done starting as a highschool freshman all the way till the last few months of my senior year!
